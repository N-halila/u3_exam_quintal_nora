This robot has 3 omnidirectional wheels with 3 rotational dc motors, position sensors and distance sensors
for the motor, i take into consideration the information that the professor give us in the datasheet and then says 
that no-load speed is 290 rpm if we have to convert that to radians over seconds so we implement the following formula
ω(rad.s)=2π/60.N(rpm) this is to divide 2pi between 60 and then multiplied for the number of revolutions and this gives me 3036873radians/seconds.
For the maximun torque is something similar we have from the datasheet 120 oz.in and we have to convert it to newton per meter in this case i apply a rule of three that was simplier that use the entire formula, this means that knowing that 1 oz-in is equal to 0.00706 newton meter, i just multiplied it and it gives me 0.84738621 n.m.

In the case of the position sensor i have to know the resolution and for that one i use according to the datasheet of our motor
the quantity of counts per revolution that in my case was 1632.67 and i divide 2pi that is an entire round between the counts that my sensor does per revolution so it gives me the value of 0.0038484.

Now for the distance sensor we have to take into consideration the information from the datasheet in our case this says that it has a resolution of 16 bits and an operative range that goes from 0 to 200
